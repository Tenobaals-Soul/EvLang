# EvolutionLang
An attempt to create an easy to learn language, without OOP. The language combines functional and procedual elements.

## idea
This language will have a C like syntax and not use classes. Instead it will use overloaded functions. Function can have two argument lists, so that subject.predicate(object) constructions will be possible. Also Rust like runtime pattern matching will be a thing.

## Memory management
At the moment the plan for memory safety is a reference counter combined with graph detachment checks.
