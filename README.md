# EvolutionLang
An attempt to create an easy to learn language, combining OOP, functional and procedual elements. This is mostly to see what I (a student) can do.

## idea
This language is supposed to have a easy to use Syntax. The compiler should not need semicolons. Instead it should end a statement where (for example) two values follow each other without an operator in between.

Also the main function should not be a class member, but rather be an code block existing outside a class.

## Memory management
The language should be completly memory safe. No pointers just references on a reference table. Also a garbage collector should be combined with an ownership concepts.
